# VTPythonScript

This is a Python Script that, among other things, scans a specified file folder using your VirusTotal API Key. It prints the scan results both in a log file and in the console until it finishes the scan. It relies on the other JSON files in this repository to be in the same file folder as the python script 

NOTE: This does require you to set your VirusTotal API Key as an enviornmental variable
